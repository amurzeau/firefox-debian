Subject: Bug 1388981 - Fixup EVENT__SIZEOF_OFF_T. r?jld

There are two problems related with EVENT__SIZEOF_OFF_T:
- When building Firefox with -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64, off_t is 64 bits,
  but the in-tree event-config.h still defines EVENT__SIZEOF_OFF_T to 4.
- When building Firefox *without* -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 (the default)
  against a system libevent that was built with -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64,
  its event-config.h defines EVENT__SIZEOF_OFF_T to 8, which then
  doesn't match off_t size.

For the latter, libevent actually defines its own off_t type, that
callers are supposed to use instead of off_t. So that's what our
static_assert should be checking.
